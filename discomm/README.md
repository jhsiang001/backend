# DISCOMM

Building a website that will provide as a virtual community for people. This is especially important in times like this when people are restricted to their homes.
Will be using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js to build this.

Description:
A Discord community that will allow users to connect to their Discord logins. They will then be asked for a couple of their interests and will be recommended 
certain Discord servers based on their interests. Discord servers will be submitted by server admins along with certain tags that describe their server. In
addition, users will be able to see their friends on Discord recommmend certain servers as well.
